# Telegram User Last Seen Checker

In order to make this script work, set the following variables. If you have not a Telegram Application Credentials please go to https://my.telegram.org/auth follow this steps https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id after all done you will be able to set up the next variables.

Also, you need to specify the file where the usernames are saved i suggest you to save then into a json file, 1 per 1 each line theres a users.json file included as an example (you should not try to add those users), all this to make the script work :)

This script could scrape the users of selected groups, or use a current file with usernames.

If any doubt let me know :) @SrPedro at Telegram
